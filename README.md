# Digits-Speech-Recongintion-System-In-Real-Time-Mic
This project aims to recognize spoken digits (0-9) from audio recordings using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing audio samples of spoken digits and is then used to predict the digit spoken in a given audio clip. Real-time testing allows the model to predict digits from live microphone input.
